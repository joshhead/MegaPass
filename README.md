###Mega Pass

WebOS app to save Mega Man II 5x5 grid passwords.

It presents a grid of checkboxes which are saved when the app closes.

Some of the source files refer to "Sonic Shaker" which is another small app I made and used as a template.

Not planning to fix/update, but I blogged about it and never even shared the code. So here it is.

See my [blog post](http://joshhead.wordpress.com/2011/07/10/mega-man-2-password-app/) for a screenshot.
